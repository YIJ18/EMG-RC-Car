# EMG-RC-Car üöó‚ö°

A bio-signal driven project where an RC car is controlled through **Electromyography (EMG) signals**, with **Bluetooth (HC-06)** for wireless communication.  
The system processes muscle activity, computes averaged values to improve reliability, and translates them into motor and steering commands, enabling an innovative **human‚Äìmachine interface** that bridges electronics, bio-signals, and robotics.

## üìå Overview
The EMG-RC-Car project demonstrates how **muscle signals** can be used to control robotic systems.  
By capturing EMG activity, filtering it, and averaging data for stability, the system maps signals into commands that control both **DC motors (for movement)** and a **servo motor (for steering)**.  
Wireless communication with the **HC-06 Bluetooth module** ensures portability and remote operation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YIJ18/EMG-RC-Car.git
   cd EMG-RC-Car
   ```
2. Connect the EMG sensor and servo motor to your microcontroller following the circuit diagram (see `/docs`).  
3. Pair the **HC-06 Bluetooth module** with your device (`PIN: 1234` or `0000`).  
4. Upload the firmware to the microcontroller.  
5. Run the signal acquisition and processing code (with averaging enabled).  

---

## üöÄ Usage
- Flex your muscle to trigger EMG signals.  
- The system averages the input to minimize noise spikes.  
- DC motors control movement (forward/stop), while the servo motor manages steering.  
- Commands are transmitted wirelessly through the HC-06 module.  
- Adjust thresholds and averaging parameters in the code for optimal control.  

---

## üìà Future Work
- Replace HC-06 with BLE modules for integration with mobile apps.  
- Implement adaptive filtering and machine learning for EMG pattern recognition.  
- Add sensor fusion (IMU/GPS) for advanced navigation.  
- Explore applications in prosthetics and rehabilitation robotics.
